                            <h3>Idea</h3>
                                <p>The idea was to create a graphic that visually supports the already created audio project about sleep paralysis. 
                                    The graphic project should represent the state between sleep and being awake. Since one cannot move during sleep paralysis, 
                                    the "being trapped in one's own body" should also be visually represented. To achieve an intense effect, the goal was to 
                                    link the graphic project and the audio project. </p>
                            <h3>Artistic Intention</h3>
                                <p>The protagonist of the rather abstract scenery is a small cube, which finds its place in the center of the composition. 
                                    This cube represents the (sleeping) human being. The cube is always in the center of the picture and is therefore clearly 
                                    identified as the protagonist. Around the cube are two geometric shapes, which consist exclusively of contours. These shapes 
                                    are meant to appear as cages that hold the cube captive. They symbolize, on the one hand, the cage of the body, which cannot 
                                    be moved during a sleep paralysis, and, on the other hand, the mind, which can also cause a feeling of constriction and 
                                    paranoia through threatening thoughts. These three elements move appropriately to different frequencies of the piece of 
                                    music. The cube and one of the cages (that of the mind) move appropriately to the low frequencies. These two elements move 
                                    in the same rhythm to make the common - though still fighting - attempt to rebel against the body. A pulsating effect is 
                                    created, which is supposed to give rise to a "breaking out" feeling. The antagonist in this game is represented by the 
                                    outer cage (that of the body). This tends to move to higher frequencies and pulsating inward, so that the cages sometimes 
                                    overlap. In these moments, it almost seems as if the protagonist is about to wake up and overcome sleep paralysis. Behind 
                                    these three main elements there is - at first glance - a coherent surface. When moving in three-dimensional space (user 
                                    interaction), it can be seen that there are several independent surfaces, one behind the other. These surfaces move partly 
                                    in such a way that they get in front of the cube and into the cages and thus seem to "swallow" the cube. They represent 
                                    the dream world. It is an oppressive force that wants to drag people back to sleep and has multiple dream levels. At 
                                    first glance it appears one-dimensional, but closer inspection reveals depths. In addition, the planes are "distorted" 
                                    by mouse interactions. This effect is meant to refer to the illogical aspects of dreams that often distort reality. The 
                                    last element of the composition are spheres, which also circle around the cube. They lie outside the cages and are meant 
                                    to represent reality in a waking state. They are the only round elements of the image and thus are meant to create a soft 
                                    positive and free effects. </p>
                            <h3>Technical choices</h3>
                                <p>The idea was to create a graphic that visually supports the already created audio project about sleep paralysis. 
                                The graphic project should represent the state between sleep and being awake. Since one cannot move during sleep paralysis, 
                                the "being trapped in one's own body" should also be visually represented. To achieve an intense effect, the goal was to 
                                link the graphic project and the audio project. </p>
