                <h1><b>WINDS_OF_KYOTO</b></h1>
                          <h2> by_Sebastian_Wilhelm </h2>
                              <p>Winds of Kyoto is a narrative music concrete piece as an homage to a trip to Kyoto 
                                  that didnâ€™t take place due to the outbreak of covid. As the name suggests the piece 
                                  focuses on sounds from Japanese culture propagated by the wind. The audio composition 
                                  was realized in sonic pi by procedurally composing instruments out of samples and 
                                  additive synthesis and then into progressively more complex arrangements resulting 
                                  in sections. The five sections tell a story about a lively monastery focusing on 
                                  rhythmical martial sounds from a monk training paired with a natural and peaceful 
                                  atmospheric backdrop. As the day approaches its end the composition takes you downstream 
                                  into a hidden thicket where a secret sect is performing a mischievous ritual, with the aim 
                                  of summoning a demon. The climax of the piece is the fight between the monks and the beast. 
                                  After an intense fight, the initial peace has been restored. Or so it seems. The visual motif 
                                  was procedurally built by aligning and connecting vertices sorted in a linear array. Resulting 
                                  in an origami-like strip, which reinforces the Japanese theme. The strip grows over the duration 
                                  of the piece giving an indication of time as well as twisting, turning, and expanding based on 
                                  different frequency ranges of the sounds, assuming the role of a simple spectrogram. After some 
                                  experimentation with a shader, it has been used to infuse the origami-like structure with 
                                  internal mystical energy. </p>
